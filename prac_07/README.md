-The code need to have a good name for the constants and variables. That will make the other people be easier to check the code.

-The constants should become all upper. That will let people who want to see the code be easier to resolve the constants and variables.

-The view of the code should become more clean to let the people see the parts clear, it is also good to let the creator check the code.
